# FlutterLoginPageDemo
Created a demo login page for LinkedIN.

The login screen we are going to build here is simple in its visual aspects. 
First there is a widget for the company/organization/app name.
Then about the screen itself, Sign in. Now, we have two text fields, user name and password, to get login/sign-in credentials from user. 
Then we have a FlatButton for the Forgot Password.
After that, there is the Login button. 
If the user does not have an account, there should be a provision for the Sign-up process, hence a Sign-up FlatButton.
